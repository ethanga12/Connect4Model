# Connect4Model
Logic For Systems Curiosity Modeling Project

As part of your project submission, we request a one page README.md file that provides a comprehensive overview of your implementation. This document should effectively communicate your approach and insights to someone who might be new to your chosen topic. At a minimum, you should address each of the following points:

Project Objective: What are you trying to model? Include a brief description that would give someone unfamiliar with the topic a basic understanding of your goal.


Model Design and Visualization: Give an overview of your model design choices, what checks or run statements you wrote, and what we should expect to see from an instance produced by the Sterling visualizer. How should we look at and interpret an instance created by your spec? Did you create a custom visualization, or did you use the default?


Signatures and Predicates: At a high level, what do each of your sigs and preds represent in the context of the model? Justify the purpose for their existence and how they fit together.


Testing: What tests did you write to test your model itself? What tests did you write to verify properties about your domain area? Feel free to give a high-level overview of this.


Documentation: Make sure your model and test files are well-documented. This will help in understanding the structure and logic of your project.
Your README.md should not only serve as a guide to your project but also reflect your understanding and the thought process behind your modeling decisions.
